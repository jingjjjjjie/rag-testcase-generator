          "short-answer": {
            "reason": "The sentence [Sen 53] states \"Workers should ensure they complete any necessary administrative steps to facilitate the refund process,\" which implies that completing these steps is required for the refund, but it does not explicitly state that no refund will be processed until they are completed. However, it is the most relevant sentence in the passage supporting the idea that administrative steps are a prerequisite for the refund. There is no more direct statement about eligibility conditional on completion, so [Sen 53] remains the best-supported reference available in the text.",

Although Clue 3 is not explicitly listed in the provided clues (only Clue 1 is given), the RAG answer references \"Clue 3\", implying its existence and relevance in the original context. However, based solely on the clues provided in this prompt (only Clue 1), the inferability is limited because the critical clue (Clue 3) supporting the definitive answer is not included here. Therefore, with only Clue 1 available—which mentions that administrative steps are required but does not specify consequences for non-completion—the answer cannot be fully inferred.
