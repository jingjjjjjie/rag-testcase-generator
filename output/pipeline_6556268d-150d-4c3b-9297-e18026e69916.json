            "reason": "The reference [Doc doc1_question10, Sen 51] refers to the sentence stating that the deposit and related amounts are processed within one week of return, but it does not address the condition of completing paperwork. The correct sentence that supports the requirement to complete administrative steps is [Sen 53], which explicitly states that workers must complete necessary administrative steps to facilitate the refund process. Therefore, including [Sen 51] is misleading as it discusses timing under normal conditions, while [Sen 53] directly addresses the prerequisite of administrative completion. The accurate reference should only be [Sen 53].",

        "answer-relevance-reason": "The answer directly addresses the question by clearly stating that the deposit and related costs (including airfare) will not be refunded until all necessary paperwork is completed after returning from holiday. It aligns well with the user's inquiry about eligibility for a refund in the context of uncompleted paperwork. The response is concise, on-topic, and fully relevant to the conditions affecting refund eligibility.",

        "answer-practicality-reason": "The question is highly relevant to individuals who have returned from a holiday and are seeking reimbursement of deposit and airfare costs. It addresses a common concern about financial refunds tied to administrative requirements, which many travelers or employees may face. The answer provides clear, actionable information that directly impacts the individual's ability to recover expenses, making it highly practical for the target audience.",

        "answer-semantic-similarity-reason": "The question asks about eligibility for a refund of deposit and airfare costs when required paperwork has not been completed after returning from holiday. The clues indicate that refunds are processed within a week of return (clue 1) but also mention that workers must complete necessary administrative steps (clue 2), which directly relates to the \"required paperwork\" mentioned in the question. Thus, there is a strong thematic connection regarding refund eligibility contingent on administrative compliance. However, the clues do not explicitly confirm whether failure to complete paperwork results in denial of refund, so the alignment, while strong, is not perfect. Still, the core themes—refunds, deposits, airfare, and paperwork—are closely aligned.",
        "answer-semantic-similarity-score": 4,
        "answer-inferability-reason": "The answer states that the deposit and airfare costs will not be processed until all necessary administrative steps are completed, which directly combines Clue 1 (refunds processed after return) and Clue 2 (requirement to complete administrative steps). Although Clue 1 mentions processing after return, it does not specify conditions for withholding if paperwork is incomplete. However, Clue 2 implies that completing administrative steps is required for the refund process. The synthesis of these two clues—particularly interpreting that failure to complete paperwork prevents processing—leads logically to the answer. The reasoning is clear and grounded in the clues, with both contributing meaningfully.",

The clue mentions that if there are delays in the refund process, individuals should consult a designated department for resolution.
